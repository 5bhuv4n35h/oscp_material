STATUS REMOTE OVERFLOW - by duke(duke@viper.net.au || duke@el8.org)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, just a couple of things to note when using this..

1) When you exploit this program (100024) it generates a syslog warning 
   message to the console and leaves a big entry in logs.. so clean up 
   and be careful ;)

2) This causes rpc.statd to crash, so you only really get one shot unless they 
   restart it.

3) The return address i used was successful when starting rpc.statd from the 
   command line.. might need a different offset or something try a negative 
   value.

4) I'm not responsible for what you do with this. Have fun ;)
